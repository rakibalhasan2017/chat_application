This is my first full-stack project, which took 12+ days to complete. I learned a lot from this project, especially how to manage and implement a project step by step. I discovered how to keep myself motivated and make consistent progress by breaking the work down into smaller tasks. Previously, all the projects I worked on were completed in 1-2 days, so this was the longest project Iâ€™ve worked on so far.

# Tools Used
MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
# New Technologies I Learned

# Zustand:
This was my first time implementing state management on a larger scale (for me, it's huge!).
# WebSockets:
I learned how real-time data fetching works.
# useRef Hook:
I got familiar with using the useRef hook for the first time.
# JWT Authentication:
While I already knew how JWT works, this project improved my ability to handle tokens stored in cookies.
# File/Image Upload:
I learned how to upload files and images. In this project, I saved images to Cloudinary and stored the secure key in the database. This was my first time working with file uploads and form data.
